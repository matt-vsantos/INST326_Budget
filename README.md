# INST326_Budget

Our project will enable users to create a categorical budget. Using the income, users will be able to list their monthly expenses such as rent and car payments. With the remaining money, users will be able to set budget amounts for other categories such as food, gas, self care, and entertainment. They will be able to insert expenses into any category and the program will tell them when theyâ€™ve exceeded their listed budget. 

TESTING:
Make sure all of the files are in the same folder. From the command line, run the following:

    python3 Budget_gui.py
